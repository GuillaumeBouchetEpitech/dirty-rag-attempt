William Shakespeare (1564-1616)

Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He was a playwright and actor and wrote many poems and plays. His most famous plays include A Midsummer Night’s dream, Hamlet, Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet. He also dramatised significant events from the past, but he did not focus solely on kings and queens. He was one of the first to portray ordinary Englishmen and women. Shakespeare had a great influence on the English language and invented many words that are still common today. Lines from his plays and poems which are often still quoted include:

• Once more unto the breach (Henry V)

• To be or not to be (Hamlet)

• A rose by any other name (Romeo and Juliet)

• All the world’s a stage (As You Like It)

• The darling buds of May (Sonnet 18 – Shall I Compare Thee To A Summer’s Day)
